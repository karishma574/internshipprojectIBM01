## üìñ Project Description

The Library AI Agent is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to modernize the library experience for students. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand queries in plain English and intelligently recommend relevant academic books based on the user's course syllabus, interests, and academic progress. Developed using IBM Cloud services like Watson NLP and Cloudant, this system brings smart automation to educational resource discovery.

## üí° Need for the Project

Traditional library systems require users to know exact book titles or authors, making the search process time-consuming and inefficient. Students often struggle to find course-specific materials or updated editions without guidance. There's a growing need for a smarter, more personalized system that can bridge this gap using artificial intelligence.

## üéì Role in Students' Lives

This AI agent acts as a personalized academic guide, helping students:
- Discover the right books without knowing exact keywords
- Get instant access to book availability and reservation options
- Stay updated on high-demand resources during exams or projects

By aligning book suggestions with the course syllabus and real-time needs, it enhances the overall academic experience.
